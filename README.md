Supermarket Pricing

The problem domain is something seemingly simple: pricing goods at supermarkets.

Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65. Other things have more complex prices. For example:

• three for a dollar (so what’s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)

• $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)

• buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)
